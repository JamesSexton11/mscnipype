# mscnipype
This repository hosts the Nipype (Python) scripted pipeline used to preprocess resting-state fMRI data. This pipeline incorporates the following packages:

FMRIB Software Library (FSL) (Smith et al., 2004; Woolrich et al., 2009)

AFNI (Cox, 1996; Cox & Hyde, 1997; Gold et al., 1998)

Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS)(Avants et al., 2014).

This jupyter notebook contains cells for each major section of preprocessing. 
Any errors or pull-requests will be addressed as time allows. 

Thank you kindly,

James D. Sexton
